/*
The Calculator class uses two buffers, leftOperand and rightOperand, to store numbers and
performs expressions evaluations accordingly to the buttons pressed.

While a number is being input, it's stored in the rightOperand buffer. Digits of the
number are input successively by pressing the corresponding buttons. On each subsequent button
press, the buffer content is multiplied by 10, then the corresponding digit is added.

If a decimal separator (.) button was pressed, the program switches into the fractional
part input mode (fractDivider counter is assigned 1). In this mode, each subsequent digit
is divided by 10^fractDivider and the result is added to the rightOperand buffer, while
fractDivider is incremented by 1.

After an action has been selected (+,-,*,/ button was pressed), the rightOperand buffer
content is copied to the leftOperand, the flag flushROpNeeded is set to true, and the selected
action is memorized in selectedAction variable. On a subsequent numeric button press,
the rightOperand will be cleared (set to 0) as well as the flag.
Such approach enables short operations, like [3][+][=] (equivalent to [3][+][3][=]) etc.

After the [=] button was pressed, the two operands are processed accordingly to the selected
action, and the resulting value is stored in the leftOperand buffer. At the same time,
flushActNeeded flag is set, but the rightOperand and the selectedAction variables still store
their values to make repeated [=] action possible: [3][+][=][=] works as [3][+][3][+][3][=].

If an action has been selected, but the [=] button was not pressed, the corresponding
expression will be evaluated on a subsequent action button press, and the result will be stored
in the leftOperand. Thus, the previous action will not be lost and [3][+][3][+][3][=] will
actually be 9.

Functions are executed immediately and the value of the rightOperand will be replaceb
by the calculation result.
